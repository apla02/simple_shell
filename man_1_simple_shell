.\" Manpage for Shell

.TH dash 1 "06 August 2020" "1.0" "shell man page"

.SH NAME
    sh - interface to the Unix system kernel

.SH SYNOPSIS
    $ [command] [-flags ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
     A Shell provides you with an interface to the system kernel.
     It gathers input from you and  executes  programs  based on
     that input. When a program  finishes executing, it displays
     that command's output followed by a new prompt.

.SH PROMPT
     The  prompt,  $,  which  is  called  the command prompt, is
     issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can
     type a command.
     Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines
     the command you want  executed by looking at the first word
     of  your  input. A  word  is  an unbroken set of characters.
     Spaces and tabs separate words.


.SH OPTIONS

Built-ins

     cd [arg]
     Change  the  current working directory. The shell parameter
     $HOME is the default if no directory is specified. If no
     directory arg is found and the  $CDPATH   parameter  contains
     a  list  of directories separated by colons, each of these
     directories is used as a prefix to arg in the given order,
     and the current directory is set to the first one that is found.
     $ cd /usf/lb

     env
     Prints the current environment

     exit [n]
     Causes the shell to exit with the exit status  specified by
     n. If n is omitted then the exit status is that of the last
     command executed. (An end of file will  also exit  from the
     shell).
